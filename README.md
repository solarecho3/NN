# NN
My neural net for exploring neural network technology from the ground up, in python.

## Currently
Instantiate a Neuron with an input vector or matrix. The Neuron will initialize with a vector or matrix of matching shape, containing randomized weights and biases. Capable of performing dot and matrix products. The class can also generate a networkx diagram of the neural structure, for examination.

One can also instantiate a Layer, with n neurons.
